### not a writer

i am not a writer. and this is not a journal.

there may not be a [[humble-beginnings|you]]. but this is still addressed to you. and these are still stories.

but even though this is addressed to you, this is still for me. indeed, even though i write in plain english, you may not even be able to understand this. at least, that's what someone from [[yvr|my past]] told me about my previous notes.

"i read some, but i feel like i'd need to be inside your brain to understand it".

i'm still trying to decide if that's ok. these entries should be raw and they should be _me_, but they should still be comprehensible. not because i care if you understand[^1] but because if my accounts are deemed too arcane by people who know me, does that mean i don't understand me either?

[^1]: like i said, this is for me
