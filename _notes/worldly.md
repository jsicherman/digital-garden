### creature comforts

i have become far [[home|too comfortable]] with life in the west and take much for granted. perhaps it isn't a matter of west-is-best so much as it is the correlates of life here. as i settle back in to life in the us after two weeks in europe, i find myself revisiting some of my old thoughts on what makes a home.

you see, over the last few weeks, i leapfrogged from zurich to london to edinburgh to manchester to berlin to dat√ßa to istanbul. although i was mostly visiting friends, i also spent a lot of time with myself, or with strangers[^1], and considering whether i could live in these various cities.

[^1]: it is markedly un-american to solicit conversation from strangers at a cafe, or a restaurant, or a river. but generally accepted by europeans.

when i returned to san francisco, i found myself hit with something that i had forgotten about during my time abroad: the [[yvr|smell of urine]] in the streets and the culturally enforced need to mind my own business at cafes.

maybe it's time for a new adventure.
