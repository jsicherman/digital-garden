### "thoughtless and mean"

it's no secret that my family life is a bit <del style="line-height: 1.3;"><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></del>. that's nothing new. since a very young age i've maintained a very clear separation between church and state.

at the time, it was out of necessity for my sanity. i observed some obviously problematic ways that my family interacted with each other and endeavored to stay out of it. something (minor?) would happen, causing a (major?) reaction, and the positive feedback loop of pain would begin.

i developed a strong aversion to conflict.

### "act like you give a shit"

i also developed a strong sense of independence. which is a trait that i prided myself on throughout high school and most of my undergrad. only towards the end of my university degree did i start to question its utility, prompted by [[home|my person (at the time)]].

you see, although she'd claim otherwise, she wasn't very independent (at the time). perhaps i judged that to some extent, but it created an important opportunity for [[sawtooth|connection]].

supporting her in her uncertainties made me feel _useful_. like i was really a part of her life. and -- although i don't want to speak for her -- it made her feel _loved_.

but i struggled to receive the same support. rather, the <del style="line-height: 1.3;"><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></del> surrounding my family life and childhood led me to do everything for myself and feel very uncomfortable asking for help.

this is not a novel or interesting statement, but i figure i should at least state it: this is not a good way to receive love. especially not inasfar as it enables avoidance.

naturally, it has caused rifts in my family life and relationships as an adult. i won't deny that the common fate of my love life is to end in a fiery wreckage where minor conflict causes me to become avoidant, causing my partner to not feel sufficiently loved (and we tailspin until breaking up in the atmosphere).

i also won't deny that while the family issues i had while growing up were mostly not fault of my own, the same is likely not true today.

### "i've given up"

the consensus from the [[yvr|family i "made"]] (and historically with the family i "chose") is generally not as clear. some people hyperbolize that i'm the most thoughtful person they know, while others write entire poems about my rock hard shell[^1].

[^1]: although the same stanza claims my interactions are warm and camaradic

maybe there's no objective conclusion to draw here. maybe the headings (although they are only three of many) _are_ a fair characterization of my failings.

but maybe i've been wrong all along. maybe it's not about being overly independent... maybe it's about a lack of trust. maybe my friends trust me (because i can fend for myself). maybe my "family" -- romantic partner included in this definition of the word -- does not (because i fend for myself).

maybe i can maintain my independence and also cultivate a family, and it "just" requires a little trust.
