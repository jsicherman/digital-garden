### physical, mental and behavioral

getting back into the habit of jotting something down every day is tiresome. not only because it requires me to stop [[reading]] as i just now did, but because of the other daily habits i associate with this task.

stretching. tracking my nutrition. working out. practicing my russian.

### sub picture-element resolution

the central issue, as it always has been, is instrument sensitivity. daily measurements come in below the noise floor.

maybe "sticking to it" counts as algorithm improvements. maybe the exposure time was just too short.

### non mirum

i'm never surprised -- but always entertained -- to see that an english word (and especially a word related to biology) is just a latin portmanteau[^1].

[^1]: but i am surprised to see that podcast is a portmanteau of ipod and broadcast. what a [[wordsmith|blandiose language]].

but it's a shame circahebdomadian doesn't have the same ring to it.
