### probability

at its extreme end, one might call them miracles. allow me to propose an intuitive definition: "the occurrence of an extremely unlikely event which lacks (an apparent) causal connection". surely such a definition must also involve a discussion about probability, but how unlikely is sufficiently unlikely?

if you had to estimate it, what would you say? one-in-a-million?

### inevitability

if you would, then consider the following. if you are awake for 8 hours per day, and during that time, experience one event per second that _may_ give rise to a miracle, then on average, you should experience a miracle once every 35 days[^1].

but surely a miracle experienced at that frequency would more readily classify as coincidence, and either miracles cannot exist, or we've made a mistake in our estimation.

[^1]: we arrive at one miracle per lifetime if we assume that the probability of experiencing one is a paltry 0.0000001057%.

### acausal connectivity

whatever name you ascribe to these events, what is ultimately interesting about them either spiritually or probabilistically is when they start to pile up, as if [[facts|entangled]]. i have previously written about chance and randomness: what i am interested with herein is their meaning, if indeed there is any.

### connexity

chance encounters in foreign streets? perceived relevance in each other horoscopes? remote work arrangements? unprovoked photos of undisclosed apartments? olives?

### synchronicity

to jung, these kinds of subjective experiences are a legitimate function of a healthy mind (or at least up until what conrad describes instead as apophenia).

i guess it remains to be seen if i will am due to descend into paranoid schizophrenia. with any luck, we'll soon find out whether it is delusion, quantum intervention, fate or a statistical certainty.
