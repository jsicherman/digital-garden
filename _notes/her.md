### somehow

i [[a-feeling|previously wrote]] that my person is more of a shadow in this place than a glow. but i guess that depends on what i meant by "this place"[^1]. because when i turn off my mind and put myself at the mercy of my own legs,

[^1]: or equally, "shadow".

### i always end up here.

and that isn't a bad thing. one of the special things about this place is how <sub><sup>smol</sup></sub> it makes me feel. after all, the universe declines toward chaos and decay and all i can do is grasp for stability and permanence by trying to carve out a solid sense of self in a mere blink of existence.

chance shook me into awareness -- into humility -- to the fragility of a world that flourished long before i trampled it with my arrogant footsteps.

### that world should continue to flourish long after i have gone.
