### a fresh fit

it is perhaps fitting that the chronological neighbor of [[style]] is this. but it does require some context.

you see, i was reviewing my finances last week, which led me to realize that i'm not doing much with my money, and it started to burn a hole in my pocket.

fast forward a week and i'm now sporting a new wardrobe with organic/designer brands, ultra-soft turkish cotton bath sheets[^1], high thread-count italian percale sheets and handcrafted karelian birchwood/sg2 micro-carbide knives.

[^1]: like a towel, only larger and more luxurious.

one thing i can't justify the $5000 price tag on is some tongue-in-cheek [art](http://www.danielallencohen.com/periodic-table-of-addiction.html), and i think i can make it just as well[^2]. another thing i'll also (probably) hold off on is stocking my kitchen with my favorite [japanese elegance](https://musubikiln.com/collections/stylish-and-modern-collection). of course i'll also pay down more of my mortgage and invest a large chunk of the remaining money _soon_ (read as: depending on how many more luxury items i can find), but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

[^2]: indeed i've got the parts for a proof-of-concept on the printer even as i type this.
