### identity crisis

i have, on more than one occassion, been accused of being reckless[^1]. despite this oft perscribed identity, i tend to disagree. so why do i get stuck with this label?

[^1]: indeed it was one of the more significant disagreements i had with [[home|my]] [[sawtooth|person]]

well, there are some things that i can immediately identify...
1. i injected a magnet into my hand
2. then i injected an nfc chip into my hand
3. i ride a 22mph electric longboard
4. and a 19mph self-balancing one-wheeled board
5. i'm usually the first to jump/dive/flip off cliffs into various bodies of water
6. when i drive i (sometimes) speed (sometimes) distractedly
7. and a small variety of things i cannot legally disclose on this site

sometimes i'm even still called reckless for that one time i "hacked" boosted boards and posted a (somewhat) privacy-filtered data dump on their reddit, which i think is a little unfair.

despite these, i think i'm actually quite prudent.

### calculated risks

i won't pretend to argue that distracted driving is not reckless. mea culpa, that is just a flaw in my personality. but i maintain that there is value in the self-confidence that comes from taking calculated risks.
