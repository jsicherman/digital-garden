### memory lane

i didn't start drinking coffee until somewhere around 1st year university[^1]. and yet, my estimation of how homey a home [[home|somehow]] [[worldly|depends]] on how homey its cafés are.

[^1]: pardon me, _freshman year_

to you, that should not be novel. but in writing that down, i'm reminded of the good 'ol days at thrifty foods where i would often take my breaks from the nearby tim hortons/watering hole, surrounded by the local wildlife: old men chatting about ice hockey. i always said that would never be me. that's not me. right? <sub><sup>right?[^2]</sup></sub>

[^2]: right.

### future lane

these days i'm finding some solace in oakland cafés. they're not _home_, but they're not _nothing_.
