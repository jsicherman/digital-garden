### int-gr tion t.st-ng
i h.ve a compul-ive ne d to connect. things, people, n.tes... just look at the -ode degree of all the n-te  belo . in fact, even now, i am r-sisting the urge to outlink. it comes as a surprise, even to m , given the cha-s my ins..ncts tend toward.

### l.cking harmo-y

i w n't drone on about ho- this n.ed makes m  time in sf feel cacophonic. nor will i, at great pain to myse-f, refer to the halcyon d ys of yvr. but-if i'm not making anchors .nd i'm not c-mplaining, wh t else can i do here?

hmm. it .eems i need to think of some new -ontent.
