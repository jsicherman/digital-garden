### creating (interesting) stuff

today i spent a bit of time giving my site a quick facelift. it is, of course, partially the result of my recent musings on [[style]][^1], but also partially inspired by a [danish game developer](https://github.com/SebLague).

[^1]: speaking of, my sample size has grown to [4440 pages](https://www.goodreads.com/review/stats/169189345#pages) and my stylistic preferences remain unchanged.

now, there is another thing worth saying, and it is that there is another similar inspiration, and that is a [web tool](https://xenium.10xgenomics.com/?image=s3%2F10x.files%2Fxenium%2Fpreview%2Fhbreast%2Fexperiment.xenium&zoom=0.0254&target=17708_12889&z=17&off=&layers=cell~image&nav=true&axes=false&feature=icon&feature_psc=6&feature_ps=circles&ii_n=H%26E%20Image&ii_p=s3%2F10x.files%2Fxenium%2Fpreview%2FXenium_FFPE_Human_Breast_Cancer_Rep1%2FXenium_FFPE_Human_Breast_Cancer_Rep1_he_image_registered.ome.tif&ii_t=AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPA%2F&ii_v=false&feature_off=313_541&bin=10&d_c=Viridis&d_o=0.8&cell_bt=cell&cell_c=groups&cell_g=0&cell_o=0.5&ct_c=Viridis&ct_o=0.8&cell_v=filled) which is developed at my workplace. perhaps in the not-too-distant future i will begin some explorations of my own, and get some unity webgl projects going.

until then, please enjoy a pixelated dinosaur tiptoeing in place.
