### an old assumption

when i was visiting/interviewing in the bay area (post covid)[^1], i stayed in a victorian style airbnb in the presidio with my partner at the time. as it happens, that was the worst mistake i could have made.

[^1]: i had previously visited san francisco with [[home|my person]] before covid while _she_ was interviewing, and my memories are effectively "wow this is so nice and artsy and bustling" up until she left (which is the same moment we broke up), at which point i spent the rest of the day by myself being miserable in the mission.

as i wandered around pac heights, russian hill, the richmond and the sunset, the city had seemingly infinite charm. it was like strolling through the old town in spain. i blindly assumed that the relaxed elegance applied to the whole city and when it came time to sign a lease, i chose the most luxurious building that was connected to bart, which happened to be in soma[^2].

[^2]: my tendency to live in luxury is my [[vanity|fatal flaw]].

### a new discovery

i think in the last two weeks i've finally cracked the secret of san francisco. looking back, i should have known it all along. because like it has always been, the secret is to just look further west [^3].

[^3]: and it seems i'm not the first to discover this secret. these [[java|caf√©s]] are always lined up around the block.

as it happens, i picked a [[yvr|bad part of town]] to live. granted, i did so without really seeing the area, and the geographical breakdown of neighborhoods in this city is something i still haven't really learned. but i have made a few simplifying discoveries.

1. nobody really goes to the southern half of the city so you can basically ignore everything from bernal heights down
2. the bart line runs north/south along inner mission and then continues northeast through soma and into the east bay, so it is the most populated and touristic
3. the northwest is very posh and disconnected from transit, and therefore very quiet

now, none of this is particularly novel. but what _is_ novel is the following: it's no different from vancouver. the touristic areas are the worst areas in town.
