### a weak

i could blame [[wordsmith|writer's block]]. or the difficulty still associated with [[our-first-fight|notetaking on the go]]. but i won't.

i could also say that suddenly, life got busy.

but that's a terrible excuse and i know it. in reality, new habits are just hard to form, and i lost my motivation to put in the effort. extrinsic motivation is perhaps a slippery slope, but it is an effective way to solidify a habit (although i'm not entirely sure this counts as extrinsic motivation).

you see, i thought about sitting down to write something a few times in the last week, but i just didn't prioritize it enough.

and now, there's a one week gap in the history of my brain. this is a note to plant a flag in the ground and say that tomorrow, we're back to our regularly scheduled programming.
