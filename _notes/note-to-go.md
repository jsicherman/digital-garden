### i take it for granted

i'm an android user. but more than that, i'm an autocorrect abuser. ui size: smallest. font size: tiny. thumb size: xl.

fortunately, it means that i don't actually have to consider which letters i'm hitting and i can instead just conjure up words from the english/french/spanish/russian dictionary with a quick swipe.

unfortunately, it also autocorrects capitalization.

worse yet, github mobile doesn't allow you to create files, and github web (on mobile) has no shortage of issues with soft wrapping and deleting lines randomly. ask me how i know.



### note2slow

as i navigate these [[humble beginnings]], i find myself in need of a way to jot down notes on the fly. needing to continuously [[a case on case|downcase my words]], repair my typos and fight with github's ui just isn't going to cut it.

on the bright side: emojis are much more accessible ðŸ¤

when you hear from me next, it'll be from the comfort of my laptop. or the comfort of a better mobile text editor. surely there's something at least somewhat sane.but either way, i'm committed to my own comfort.
