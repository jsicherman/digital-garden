title: our first fight

### it's not me, it's you

as i navigate these [[humble beginnings]], i find myself in need of a way to jot down notes on the fly. needing to continuously [[a case on case|downcase my words]], repair my typos and fight with github's ui just isn't going to cut it.

on the bright side: emojis are much more accessible ðŸ¤ 

### i take you for granted

ui size: smallest. font size: tiny. thumb size: xl. don't just take my word for it, look at the data:

autocorrect means that i don't actually have to consider which letters i'm hitting and i can instead just conjure up words from the english/french/spanish/russian dictionary with a quick swipe. unfortunately,
1. it also autocorrects capitalization
2. github mobile doesn't allow you to create files, and
3. github web (on mobile) file editing is broken

### the philosophy of notetaking

surely there's a better way. but if there's not, it begs the question: can notes be edited once they're pushed? i mean, obviously they _can_ be (these very words are evidence of that), but *can* they be?

admittedly this isn't a topic that came up in my readings of nietzsche and plato.

i'll propose that as long as the spirit of the note remains unchanged, then an edit for clarity, spelling or syntax remains totally permissible. these should hopefully be minimal.

and so, with that moral quandary dealt with in the most analytic possible way, i suppose the resolution is clear. when you hear from me next, it'll be from the comfort of my laptop. or the comfort of a better mobile text editor. perhaps our first fight will then be our last.
