### 6Ï€

it's no secret that home is on my mind of late. whether that home is [[yvr]] or otherwise, that home requires attachment.

attachment requires time, and historically my $$\text{effort} = \cos(time + \pi) + 1$$. effort. stability. disruption. effort. stability again.

### 137 days

it seems that connection is just the additive synthesis of effort over time. $$\text{connection}(\text{time}) = 2 \left(\text{time} - \left\lfloor \text{time} + {\tfrac{1}{2}} \right\rfloor \right), \text{time} - {\tfrac{1}{2}} \notin \mathbb{Z}$$. so perhaps it's no surprise that the cliff is so harsh.

it begs the question: is it the contrast i feel more than the detachment itself? i hadn't considered it until just now, but it seems like it tracks.

when i left [[home|shawnigan lake]] for waterloo, it took me about 150 days to start to put down roots. when my person (my home) left me in waterloo and i left waterloo for [[yvr]], it took me about 250.

if you factor in that vancouver was the closest i've felt to a home, that math is not encouraging.

### the inflection point

i'm over the cliff. but maybe i'm not at the inflection point. maybe there's a magical place. a crazy person who makes this crazy place just a little more homey.

maybe.
