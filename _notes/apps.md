### 26m

moving from [[yvr]] and leaving [[mi casa es...|my people]] has certainly been an adventure. every now and then, i'm reminded of [[sawtooth|home]] (either by my friends here or by my dates during the standard "getting to know you questions"). it's not very surprising to me, but i do genuinely enjoy being considered "different" (people like canadians, eh?).

even though canada and the us are more or less fraternal twins, being a foreigner bleeds into pretty much every part of my life here. dating, as it always has been, is an an important part of that lately. if nothing else, it's a great way to see the city.

now, i didn't necessarily plan to move to sf solo[^1]. but now that i'm here, what is there to do, other than to download the apps?

[^1]: what straight male moves here for the dating scene?

### ____, lovers or nothing

so far, i hate pretty much everything about the apps.

but it might not just be about being a recently(ish) single foreigner in a new city/country/the gay capital of the world. it's also really my first time on the apps[^2] (unless you consider that time i got banned from tinder).

[^2]: technically, just "app"

the premise is good, but it's just so dang impersonal. i've gone on my share of dates since arriving here and within minutes of sitting down at whatever bar or restaurant we've agreed on, you both know exactly where the night is headed. spoiler alert: it never ends with genuine connection.

meeting people in person instead of behind a screen is a luxury i've been afforded for the entirety of my adult life up until now. getting to know somebody as a person first, before slowly finding yourselves texting more often, smiling at each others' stupid jokes, testing out the waters...

the anticipation is half (or more) of the fun of dating.

if only i was more patient.
