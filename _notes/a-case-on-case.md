### CASE WHEN

i believe i'm one of the very few in 2023 that texts from my laptop with perfect grammatical sensitivity. sentence case, apostrophes... i'll even copy-paste an em dash from google if the need arises. surely this is immediately evident based on my self-description in [[humble-beginnings]] and my abundance of lowercase thus far.

in truth, keeping my pinky off the shift key is a tremendous strain, and i find myself ctrl+lefting to correct my incorrectly "correct" casing at least once per sentence. maybe i'll get accustomed to it eventually <sub><sup>(i won't)</sup></sub>. despite that, this small rebellion against the established order will herein exist to preserve my sanity, and feed my self-image of a mind in disarray. after all, you already know that the organizational overhead of notetaking is not my natural state.

not insignificantly, it also creates great opportunities for low-effort typographical fluorishes.

### digitus V manus

i'll report back if the most ulnar digit of my left hand starts to shrivel up from lack of use. otherwise, expect a lot of lowercase characters, and count your blessings that i didn't opt for lower_snake_case as my insurrection of choice.
