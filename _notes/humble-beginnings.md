### and so we go

those of you that know me know that i'm not much of a notetaker. not through high school, where my 3-ringed binders were usually absent paper. or through undergrad, when 3-ringed binders gave way to lofty ambitions and a Surface Book 2 which rarely (never) flipped into inking mode. especially not in grad school where my research ponderings were lucky to make it from my brain to a sticky note in heavy abbreviation[^1].

[^1]: it's a good thing nobody ever let me into a wet lab

luckily, most of you <sub><sup>(is there a "you"?)</sup></sub> don't know me.

### notes for lecture on Relativity. probably Zuerich

it's commonly said that smart people have messy handwriting. einstein is universally quoted as an example. there are more: franz kafka, sigmund freud, bill gates, ...[^2]. proponents rationalize simply: "your brain works faster than your hands". i don't claim to know the science behind it. despite possible correlates — and my obvious likeness to all of the personalities above — there are obvious benefits to being able to take good notes.

to that end, i present this: a note. legible, orderly, and meticulously spel-cheked.

[^2]: this list might be longer if more so-called genuises kept better notes to be eventually posted on websites judging their notes

### the right word at the right time

i'll make an excuse for myself right at the outset: journaling, notetaking, _reflecting_... the process by which words find their way from my brain onto a defined medium at a defined cadence... it's not my strong suit. so if i falter, please return to re-read the previous sentence and get off my ass. but then read on, because the it's also the reason i'm beginning to begin.

these notes will be about everything and nothing. perhaps sometimes i'll ramble (i will). perhaps sometimes no more than a single phrase. non-english. non-sensical. it's all fair play, and hopefully my ocd will continue to compel me to outlink appropriately and lay order to the chaos.

and so we go.
