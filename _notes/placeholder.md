### paradox of choice

this morning i sat on muni on the way to a clinic, and then i sat on bart on the way to work. this evening i sat on bart on the way back home. only now that i'm home are there words on this screen. for those of you that are counting, that's almost 2 hours of staring at an empty page. it doesn't bode well for this [[humble beginnings|experiment]] in [[not a journal|not-journaling]].

surely i can blame the words at my disposal.

i've spent a lot of time around internationals, and the one thing they all say is that english is a very limiting language. it lacks _richness_. how can you express yourself with so few words?

actually, i don't agree with that assessment.

### много слов

the girl that i knew to express herself the most and complain about english relentlessly was russian. and indeed, the english dictionary (~600k words) is around 3x larger than the russian one.

it's clearly not true that our options are limited. however (and this estimate varies wildly) only around 10k words are necessary for fluency in either language.

as a percentage, this would imply that only 1.6% of english language is actively used, while about 5% of the russian language is actively used[^1].

### de la lengua

now, the figure above is more illustrative than authoritative. it's certainly true that one reason why english has so many words is because we just steal them from other languages. however, my point is this: the words are there if you're willing to search for them.

there is no pattern which is established. set. fixed. determined. arranged. settled. laid. insisted. decided. appointed. or even entrenched.

but today, i just cannot find the words for which i'm searching.
