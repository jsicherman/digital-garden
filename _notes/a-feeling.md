title: i gotta feeling

### (woo-hoo)

guess what? i'm [[home|back]]. this time, for a bit longer than [[yvr|last]]. 159 days has passed since then, and it is true whey they say: absence makes the heart grow fonder. also, time heals all wounds[^1]. judging by my previous [[sawtooth|calculations]], i should be nearing the inflection point.

[^1]: fortune also favors the bold, the only constant in life is change, and rainbows taste best when toasted[^2].
[^2]: ok that last one was nonsense.

vancouver still feels like home, but i no longer feel like a stranger in this city. perhaps part of it is that i have convinced myself that i'll be here again to stay before long. but there are very tangible things that ground me to this city, too.

for starters, there are my friends, whose lives remain mostly unchanged. then there is evo. the moroccan theoretical physicist. the [[java|caf√©s]]. the girls i see on [[apps|hinge]]. speaking of the girls...

### that tonight's gonna be a good night

this place no longer reminds me so strongly of my person. that's not to say that it doesn't - i can still see her in the various places i used to take her, but the image is only fleeting. in her place are opportunities popping up like curly haired pirates from young adult fiction[^3]. and so, i _will_ be back. and so, [[humble-beginnings|we go]].

[^3]: i definitely should have gotten her number.
