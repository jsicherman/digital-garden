### can work be play?

i work. a lot.

what i mean by that is, i like my job, and i think i'm pretty good at it too[^1]. but i sometimes use it as an excuse to not engage with my hobbies.

[^1]: and thank god for that - my visa wouldn't let me stay [[1223 days|here]] otherwise

i think that's a bad thing. and it's been a part of my personality for as long as i can remember. when my dad used to be able to ground me, he'd do so by blocking my access to the website where i wrote and sold java games. even now, i've just left work, even though today is thursday and thursday means spikeball. somehow, "work" is my prioritized method of "fun".

### 2006

a lot of my friends suffer the same phenotype. i guess this makes sense if you consider that all the fun people are hanging out with each other, and it's only us boring folk left behind. but why are we like this?

allow me to offer my thesis: twitter.

when it launched in march of 2006, the world was flying high. the human genome project was finishing up the sequence of the last chromosome, _Stardust_ had just brought comet dust back to earth, i turned the ripe old age of 9... fun was at [peak popularity](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=Fun).

since then, "fun" has steadily fallen out of style and today, we're only at 48% fun on the fun scale (in the same timespan, we're up 46% on the [boring scale](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=Boring) and 58% on the [yerba mate scale](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F01614n)).

obviously i'm joking, but the idea isn't so crazy, is it?
