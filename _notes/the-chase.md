title: the chase

### CAT and mouse

as you may know, i remain acutely interested in [[reading|etymology]]. it was then a pleasant surprise to learn the purported origin of something that i stare at probably more than anything else in the world[^1].

[^1]: no, not boobs.

the humble cursor.

### the chicken or the egg

according to roger bates (according to wikipedia), it was once neither a cursor nor a caret, but a CAT. and according to the same source, this preceeded the naming of the mouse. admittedly, this story seems a bit far fetched, and not only because the guy's name is bates. after all, the mouse has much stronger resemblance to its animal counterpart. it also doesn't _seem_ like the CAT is the one chasing the thing on my desk.

### who's chasing whom?

i won't make more excuses for my latest contribution lapse in writings. that would be so pass√©. sometimes i chase inspiration, sometimes it chases me, but for the last 82 days, the chase has come up verminless.

<h3 id="title">...</h3>

lately, inspiration has returned in the form of a book, and with it i sense it filling more than just these pages. i feel the need to asterisk that, though, because admittedly my excitement about this book, like my progress through it, is only middling. as another reader describes,
> her loooooong paragraphs about physics and morality are somewhat interesting

it may be word vomit, but
> after all, i would rather suffer through 400 pages of olivie blake's word vomit rather than another author's

### pursuits, new and old

and so, feeling inspired, i've picked up a new hobby. a new workout regimen. new friends. more dates. and, the counter rolls back from 82 to 0.

in writing that, i feel the need to point out that whether "normal" or not, my life seemingly exists in extremes. when inspiration lacks, indolence prevails and my calendar experiences a total shutdown. but when it strikes, there is a sudden surge in bookings, friendships, learnings and spendings[^2].

[^2]: nobody said inspiration came cheaply.

perhaps the valleys make the peaks more meaningful. or perhaps i need a more consistent muse.

<p id="last">or maybe, i'm just too easily frustrated by the incessant blinking of this CAT...</p>
