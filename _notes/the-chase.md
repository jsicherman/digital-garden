title: the chase

### CAT and mouse

as you may know, i remain acutely interested in [[reading|etymology]]. as such, it was a pleasant surprise to learn the purported origin of something that i stare at probably more than anything else in the world[^1].

[^1]: no, not boobs.

the humble cursor.

### the chicken or the egg

according to roger bates (according to wikipedia), it was once neither a cursor nor a caret, but a CAT. and according to the same source, the CAT came before the mouse. admittedly, this story seems a bit far fetched, and not only because the guy's name is bates. after all, the mouse has much stronger resemblance to its animal counterpart. it also doesn't _seem_ like the CAT is the one doing the chasing.

### who's chasing whom?

i won't make more excuses for my latest lapse in writings. that would be so pass√©. sometimes i chase inspiration... sometimes it chases me... but for the last 82 days, the chase has come up verminless.

<h3 id="title">...</h3>

lately, however, inspiration has returned in the form of a book. and with it i sense the filling of more than just these pages. i feel the need to asterisk that, though, because admittedly my excitement about this book, like my progress through it, is only middling. it may be word vomit, but at least her loooooong paragraphs about physics and morality are somewhat interesting. and after all, i would rather suffer through 400 pages of olivie blake's word vomit rather than another author's.

### pursuits, new and old

and so, feeling inspired, i've picked up a new hobby. a new workout regimen. new friends. more dates. and, most importantly, we don't find out how badly the ui breaks when days without incident reaches <span class="red-square">100</span>.

in writing that, i feel the need to point out that whether "normal" or not, my life is seemingly portrayed as existing in extremes. when inspiration lacks, indolence prevails and my calendar experiences a total shutdown. but when it strikes, there is a sudden surge in bookings, friendships, learnings and spendings[^2].

[^2]: nobody said inspiration came cheaply.

<p id="last">perhaps the valleys make the peaks more meaningful. or perhaps i need a more consistent muse. or maybe, i'm just too easily frustrated by the incessant blinking of this CAT...</p>
